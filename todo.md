# To Dos
- [ ] Style feed
- [ ] Display tags in PostSummary component
- [ ] Restrict covers to a certain size to prevent reflow.
  - Or is reflow really that bad?
  - Twitter just uses a spinner
- [ ] Add FollowedAuthors component
- [ ] Feed can be given a filter such as only posts by a certain author, or tag, and will display the current filter at the top of the feed with a sticky header.
